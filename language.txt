My Own summarization  :heartpulse:
The lesson itself is not that important but I think it’s very interesting !

              Language Ambiguous    
Why do we need to invent new languages like Python to programe computers , rather than using natural languages like Arabic English ?
The simple answer is because English or any language are Highly Ambiguous !
computers were stupid to understand what you mean and they don’t have brains like human .
You have to directly tell them in very simple words and very limited grammar what to do.

p.s : (Maybe computers will not be stupid anymore on account of A.I ):woman_shrugging:

There’s an old joke about the boy’s mom telling him:

“Go to the store and get a loaf of bread. If they have apples , get a dozen.” The boy comes home with a dozen loaves of bread!
You see how our natural language can be Ambiguous !

The second reason is that if we program computers in our natural languages , we are required to write extremely long texts , For example, for a simple “Hello, world!” program, we might write:

I want “Hello, world!” printed in the screen.”

“When it’s run, say: “Hello, world!”.”

“Print “Hello, world!” on the screen. And do a return/line-feed afterwards.”

“On a single line, write “Hello, world!”, but without the quotes.”

Poor computers might get confused and programmers would waste their time !
So, in order to avoid large texts… new languages have been
, created which involves limited grammar and very few words , Also the computer can easily understand !
