##################################################


The target is to simply teach you how to debug a code and find out errors "bugs",
according to Python's set of rules, 2 different issues presented here:
- Adding a space or indent before a statement that shouldn't be there will break your code,
- Changing statement's letter case will break your code, 
(for instance: Print instead of print) and
- Adding more spaces or indents after the statement won't break your code 
(for instance: "print hello" prints the same result as "print 	hello")

One important thing to note, when you 'debug' the code and get the error message, 
it is beneficial to start reading these errors from the bottom!
