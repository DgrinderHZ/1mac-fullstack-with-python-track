# Lesson 2.2: Strings

# Strings are sequences of characters that are enclosed in quotes.
# We can enclose them with single or double quotes and assign them
# to variables. We can even combine strings by adding them (we call
# this concatenation).

print 'Hello'
print "Hello"

hello = "Howdy"
print hello

# Add your own code and notes here
answer = "Hello " + hello 
print answer
