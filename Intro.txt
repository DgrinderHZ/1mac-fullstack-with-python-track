What is Programming?
Programming is the core of computer science, as most machines are built to do limited functionalities, programming is what we use to transform those machines into powerful and unlimited functionalities.

What is a Program?
A computer program is a set of instructions we put together to tell a computer what to do, how and when to do it. In short words, it enables us to turn computer into anything we can imagine!

What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a formal and unified language with a set of rules that can be used to instruct a computing device to perform a specific task according to a set of instructions called a program.

Why do we need Programming Languages?
Because of multiple reasons, but the main 2 reasons are Ambiguity and Verbosity. If we to use human languages like English or Arabic to instruct computers to do a specific task, the same word can have 2 different meanings and as a result 2 different instructions (for example, biweekly means 2 different meanings in USA and UK, Úíä in Arabic which can refer to human eye or a water space or over a dozen other meanings "see: https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/Úíä/"). Too, with different writing styles we may need a huge amount of text to tell computer to do something that programming language can tell in one line.


What is Backus Naur Form?
A notation technique, named after John Backus, used to define the syntax of a language used in computing. For instance, the computer grammar defined by a programming language would widely vary from those in a human language, as long as the end result matches the language's pre-set instructions (for example: the quiz in part 11, Python Eat Cookies).

Python Grammar for Arithmetic Expressions: part 11, it is better to watch it in full, summary won't be of much help here :)


Speedlight Example:
print (299792458*100)/1000000000.0
OR
print ((299792458*100)*(1.0/1000000000))
OR
print 299792458*100*1/1000000000.0
