To think like a programmer, you need to know how to think in 5 different ways:
1. Procedural Thinking:		take a big problem and break the solution into steps
2. Abstract Thinking:		understand and use shared patterns, knowing the abstract idea of things. i.e: 2 oranges, same as 2 apples, abstract 1+1
3. Systematic Debugging:	identify problems -or potential problems- and track down potential cause until you find the cause and fix it
4. Technological Empathy:	understanding how the computer see things, to think the way computer thinks
5. Systems Thinking:		take 1 big idea and break it down into its component pieces

Python 2 VS Python 3
There's slight differences between both versions, for example, 
in Python 3 [print] is now a function not a statement,
 in V2 we'd write [print ""] but in V3 we'd write [print ("")], too, 
in V2 if we divided whole numbers we get whole numbers without remainders, 
auto rounded to a whole number, while in V3 whole numbers divisions returns remainders
. i.e: in V2 5/2=2, 
to get remainders in V2 we'd have to write 5.0/2 
in order to get 2.5 as an answer, while in V3 5/2=2.5
